Aim: To study awk commands.

awk '{print}' file
Prints entire file

awk '{print $1,$3}' file
Prints specific fields

awk '{print $NF}' file
Prints the last field

awk '{print NR, $0}' file
adds line number at the start of each line 
Here,	NR - line number
	, - space after line number
	$0 - all lines

awk '{print NR":" $0}' file
changed the delimiter of above ' ' from space to ':'

awk -F':' '{print $1,$7}' file
changed the delimiter of above ' ' from space to ':'

awk '/pattern/' file
Print lines matching a pattern

awk 'END {print NR}' file
Print number of lines in a file

awk 'NR=="4",NR=="8" {print $0}' file
Prints data of line number 4 to 8

awk 'BEGIN {for(i=0;i<=10;i++) print i}'
a for loop which prints number from 0 to 10

awk 'BEGIN {while(i<=10) {i++; print "number is" i}}'
a while loop which prints numbers from 0 to 10

CONDITIONS:
1. to print data of salary(column 3) greater than 4000
awk '{if($3>4000) print $0}' data.lst

2. to change a data and print it
awk '{if($2=="gupta") {$5=100000} print $0}' data.lst 

3. count the occurances of a word
awk '{ for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) if ($i == "manager") count++ } END { print count }' file
